## Notes on V0 => V1  
  
Contract functionality in this version has changed from **Contract distributing tokens** to the **users distributing** their own tokens. The contract will still mint the amount needed to cover allocations, but that too could be offloaded to the user if required.   

─User[] deleted   
─getUser changed to a mapping   
─distribute() deletes   
─getWeeklyearnersCount deleted   
─struct WeeklyInfo 1) address[] payableAddr deleted 2) uint weeksEarners count deleted   
─deleted getUser()   
─added GetTotalEarned()   
─renamed getWeeklyInfoArrLength => getWeekCount   
─in weeklyEarnings() 1) removed _allEarners[] param becuase we no longer need to iterate over those who earned 2) increment totalRedeemable in UsersMap
